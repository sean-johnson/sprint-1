Part 1A:

The Command line is a computer program that allows a person to give instructions to the computer, enabling the person to change how the computer operates or carries out tasks. The person achieves these instructions by typing specific text 'commands' into the command-line interface. The computer interprets the text and translates it into a computer language that it can understands, so that it can carry out a specific task. The command line is also called Terminal or command prompt; this is because the program is 'prompting' a user to give it instructions to carry out.
